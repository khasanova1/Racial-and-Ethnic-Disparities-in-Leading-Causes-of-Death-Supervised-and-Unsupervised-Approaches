# Project Summary
# The project investigates how the leading causes of death in New York City vary by race and ethnicity across different age groups. Using data from the NYC Leading Causes of Death Dataset, the study employs both supervised learning methods (logistic regression and random forest) and unsupervised learning techniques (K-means and hierarchical clustering) to analyze the data.
